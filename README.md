# odin-recipes
This project is part of the The Odin Porject practice projects

## Learnings
During this project, I reinforced my use of anchor, image, list, and title tags.

I also learned how to use Emmet in VS Code to increase productivity when writing HTML code and the use of Root-relative links when working in a project that is in a server.
